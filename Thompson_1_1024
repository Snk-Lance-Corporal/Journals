		So far, I have just about finished building my arduino,
	aside from the buzzer that is said that I need -which I do not have
	and need to put in an order for- and that whenever I plug my arduino
	into a computer it does not work for some reason. 
	
		Other than that I just need to find some songs to program
	into it and i'll be all done.

			My Progress for this week


		Mon.  | Ask Mr.Davis why my Arduino wont work.
		Tue.  | After finding out the problem find ways to fix it.
		Wed.  | Work on finding songs.
		Thu.  | Work on the programming for songs.
