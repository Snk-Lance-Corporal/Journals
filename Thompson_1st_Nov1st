		1) I wont be adding any batteries to my project.
		2) I'm not quite sure. I think I should focus on getting
			my arduino to work first.
		3) Maybe I think it does I have actually gotten some
			parts to work but I'm not sure if it will still
			short itself later on.
		4) At first the LCD wouldn't even turn on and the entire 
			arduino would short so I guess I'm doing ok. 
		5) I should have used the wire that I am able to cut instead 
			of the average arduino wires. I always feel better
			knowing that my project is tidy.
