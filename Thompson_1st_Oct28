		Monday-Wednesday|
	Mainly Looking online at the coding and trying to understand it 
	and looking for ways I could change it.
		Thursday-Friday |
	Putting in correct parts and fixing where I place them so it is
	of convience.
		

		To make it appealing to the eye I could devorate it by 
	maybe adding extra LEDs. 

		I will add a battery as soon as I can get my project
	fully functional.
