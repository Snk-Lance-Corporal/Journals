		What I mainly got from your drawing thingy an object 
	is a list or grounp of characteristics. We use objects to define 
	whatever we are defining I think. 
	1) We can use it to manage the hard stuff in the program like a 
	library.
	2) objects are self-contained.
	3) It makes things maintainable.
